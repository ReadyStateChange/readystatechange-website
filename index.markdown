### I helped Liquid Assets efficiently handle their peak hours without adding headcount
A cutting edge AI Sommelier that helps customers find the perfect wine for their taste and budget.  The app was built using Square's API and made sure to only offer wines that are in stock at a specific location.

> Emmanuel is thorough, responsive and easy to work with. He's organized and I appreciated his weekly catch up calls to ensure no one's time was wasted, and that we were always on the same page.  He proved to be a significant upgrade from the prior software developer we asked to build the web app. If our app finds an audience, we'll certainly ask him to work on version 2.0.
